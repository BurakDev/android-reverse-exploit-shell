Android Reverse Exploit Shell (ARES)

This project is a proof of concept implementation for my master thesis. The implementation shows how an Android application without declaring any permissions in its manifest can nonetheless steal personal data from a device.

The implementation uses a vulnerability shown by Lineberry, A. and Richardson, D. and Wyatt, T. in their DEF CON 18 presentation "These Aren't The Permissions You're Looking For" and a vulnerability shown by Backes, M. and Gerling, S. and von Styp-Rekowsky, P. in their paper "A Local Cross-Site Scripting Attack against Android Phones".
